# dots
My dotfiles.

Polybar is a modified version of adi1090x's polybar-3, with color changes, cmus module and info-hackspeed module added. I also made it work on both my monitors.

2 wallpapers are included: one for your main monitor, one for the rest. They require a video wallpaper plugin to use.
